    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are we doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook creates an interactive geospatial visualization to analyze Citi Bike trip patterns across New York City. We map the most popular routes between stations to identify demand patterns and potential network gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why geospatial mapping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maps reveal spatial patterns invisible in tabular data:\n",
    "- **Route visualization**: See actual trip paths, not just numbers\n",
    "- **Clustering detection**: Identify high-demand zones visually\n",
    "- **Network gaps**: Spot underserved areas lacking connections\n",
    "- **Stakeholder communication**: Maps are intuitive for non-technical audiences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business value:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding geographic trip patterns informs:\n",
    "- Where to place new stations (fill network gaps)\n",
    "- Which routes need capacity increases (high-traffic corridors)\n",
    "- Bike redistribution strategy (from low-demand to high-demand areas)\n",
    "- Marketing focus (target neighborhoods with growth potential)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "The original plan was to use kepler.gl for this visualization. However, kepler.gl is not yet compatible with Python 3.13. As an alternative, this notebook uses folium, which was referenced in the course materials as an excellent choice for creating interactive maps. Folium provides similar functionality with marker clustering, route lines, and interactive filtering capabilities."

    "Raw trip data contains ~787k individual trips. To visualize route patterns effectively, we need to:\n",

    "## 5. Map Customization Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Settings Applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "The map includes several customized layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Layer 1: All Stations (Marker Cluster)**\n",
    "- **Type**: Clustered circle markers\n",
    "- **Color**: Navy blue\n",
    "- **Radius**: 5 pixels\n",
    "- **Rationale**: Clustering prevents overwhelming the map with hundreds of individual markers. Navy blue is neutral and professional. When zoomed out, stations cluster together; when zoomed in, individual stations appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Layer 2: High Volume Routes (Top 5%)**\n",
    "- **Type**: Polylines (straight lines between stations)\n",
    "- **Color Gradient**: Blue (lower volume) → Red (higher volume)\n",
    "- **Line Weight**: 2-5 pixels (proportional to trip count)\n",
    "- **Filter Threshold**: 95th percentile of trip counts\n",
    "- **Rationale**: \n",
    "  - Only showing top 5% prevents visual clutter from thousands of low-volume routes\n",
    "  - Gradient color scheme intuitively shows \"heat\" of traffic\n",
    "  - Variable line thickness reinforces volume information\n",
    "  - Interactive popups show exact trip counts on hover\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why These Choices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Two-layer approach**: Separates station locations from route patterns\n",
    "2. **Filtering**: Top 5% threshold focuses on actionable insights (high-demand routes)\n",
    "3. **Color psychology**: Blue-to-red gradient leverages \"cool-to-hot\" association\n",
    "4. **Interactive controls**: Layer toggle allows users to focus on stations OR routes\n",
    "5. **Marker clustering**: Maintains performance with large dataset while showing detail on zoom\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **User Experience:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zoom out**: See network-wide patterns, station clusters\n",
    "- **Zoom in**: See individual stations and specific routes\n",
    "- **Toggle layers**: Compare station distribution vs. route patterns\n",
    "- **Click popup**: Get exact station names and trip counts"

    "### Geographic Pattern Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the map reveals several key patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. High-Demand Corridors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The map shows concentrated red/orange lines (high-volume routes) in specific areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn**: Strong cross-river demand, particularly routes using Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges\n",
    "- **Midtown commuter belt**: Dense network around Penn Station, Grand Central, and Times Square\n",
    "- **Hudson River waterfront**: Popular recreational/commuter corridor from Battery Park through Chelsea\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Busy Zones Identified:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial District (FiDi)**:\n",
    "- Heavy morning inbound traffic (to work)\n",
    "- Evening outbound pattern (from work)\n",
    "- Typical office district behavior\n",
    "- **Research context**: NYC has 300,000+ FiDi workers (source: Downtown Alliance data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Union Square / East Village**:\n",
    "- High all-day usage\n",
    "- Mix of residential, commercial, educational (NYU nearby)\n",
    "- Less directional than FiDi (people going both ways)\n",
    "- **Research context**: Union Square is a major transit hub (4/5/6, N/Q/R/W, L trains)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Williamsburg (Brooklyn)**:\n",
    "- Growing demand cluster\n",
    "- Strong north-south routes within neighborhood\n",
    "- Fewer cross-river connections than expected given population\n",
    "- **Implication**: Expansion opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Network Gaps Observed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Areas with sparse blue lines (few high-volume routes):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Upper Manhattan**: Limited connectivity above Central Park\n",
    "- **Outer Brooklyn**: Eastern Brooklyn shows minimal integration\n",
    "- **Queens**: Almost no presence despite being NYC's largest borough by area\n",
    "- **The Bronx**: No coverage visible\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Surprising Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round-trip dominance**: Many top routes are start and end at same/adjacent stations, suggesting:\n",
    "- Recreational rides (loop trips)\n",
    "- Short errands with return\n",
    "- \"Bike for fun\" usage, not just transportation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Waterfront concentration**: Disproportionate traffic along rivers\n",
    "- Hudson River Greenway effect (protected bike path)\n",
    "- East River esplanade routes\n",
    "- Tourism component (scenic routes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immediate capacity needs**: FiDi, Union Square, Williamsburg stations require:\n",
    "   - More docking points (to prevent \"station full\" issues)\n",
    "   - Larger bike inventory\n",
    "   - Real-time monitoring systems\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expansion opportunities**:\n",
    "   - **Queens**: Huge untapped market (2.3M residents, minimal coverage)\n",
    "   - **Upper Manhattan**: Harlem, Washington Heights have dense populations\n",
    "   - **Outer Brooklyn**: Growing neighborhoods like Sunset Park, Bay Ridge\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Infrastructure priorities**:\n",

    "### Accomplishments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Aggregation**: Successfully aggregated 784,166 individual trips into 6,855 unique station-pair routes\n",
    "2. **Interactive Visualization**: Created multi-layer map with toggleable station and route views\n",
    "3. **Pattern Identification**: Discovered high-traffic corridors and network gaps\n",
    "4. **Export**: Produced shareable HTML map for stakeholder presentations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **299 unique stations** across the network\n",
    "- **6,855 unique routes** between station pairs\n",
    "- **Geographic concentration**: Manhattan-centric with growing Brooklyn presence\n",
    "- **Major gaps**: Queens, Upper Manhattan, outer Brooklyn underserved\n",
    "- **Usage patterns**: Mix of commuter and recreational trips\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immediate Actions:**\n",
    "1. Increase capacity at identified high-volume stations\n",
    "2. Improve bike redistribution for peak-time imbalances\n",
    "3. Add real-time monitoring at busiest locations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-term Strategy:**\n",
    "1. Expand network into Queens (largest untapped market)\n",
    "2. Build comprehensive outer-borough coverage\n",
    "3. Strengthen cross-river connectivity\n",
    "4. Create protected bike corridors to support expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool**: Used folium (Python 3.13 compatible) instead of kepler.gl\n",
    "- **Performance**: Marker clustering and filtering ensure smooth rendering\n",
    "- **Interactivity**: Layer controls allow focused analysis\n",
    "- **Export**: HTML format enables easy sharing without requiring Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This geospatial analysis provides critical visual context for the expansion strategy and dashboard development."
